Below is the entire code I utilized to develop the website's frontend, encompassing the HTML and CSS components housed within the index.html file. This code is responsible for managing the content and formatting of the static website. Additionally, I've included the JSON file (visitor-counter.js) responsible for retrieving the visitor counter number from the AWS API Gateway and DynamoDB.
